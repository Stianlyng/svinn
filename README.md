Since im a first year student, i did not know many candidates in class to collaborate on this project.
I decided to give it a try anyways, and i am glad i did. I have learned a lot during the process. 

I dedicated every waking minute this week to this project, but still i did not manage to finish all the features i wanted to implement. I ended up using H2 for the database as a result of the time constaints.
