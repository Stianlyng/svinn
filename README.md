# Voluntary project in Full Stack IDATT2105 - 2023

## By: Stian Lyng StrÃ¦te
Since im a first year student, i did not know many candidates in this class (2. year) to collaborate on this project.
I decided to give it a try anyways, and i am glad i did. I have learned a lot during the process. 

I dedicated every waking minute this week to this project, but still i did not manage to finish all the features i wanted to implement. I ended up using H2 for the database as a result of the time constaints. 

The frontend is not as polished as i would like, as i had to prioritize the backend, especially the security as i think this has to be one of the most important for assesing my project. 

## missing due to time constraints:
- Alot of documentation
- More tests
- More error handling
- More validation

# Project
An online marketplace build with a Vue 3 frontend and a spring boot backend. 


### Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- backend: spring boot project
- frontend: vue 3 project

> The token is integrated in the frontend, using the pinia store and custom axios instance.

The database is populated with data from the dataLoader file, which is located in the config folder.
